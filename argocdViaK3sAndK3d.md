## Cross post: Take Argo CD for a spin with K3s and k3d

For the second year in a row, my current employer [Bekk](https://www.bekk.no/) has set out on a ambitious December journey:
[BekkChristmas](https://bekk.christmas/), 264 tech articles in 24 days, each day of the advent calendar. 

One of the categories was [thecloud.christmas](https://thecloud.christmas/), so it felt natural to me to contribute here. 
So here it it, from the 13th of December, my post about Kubernetes, ArgoCD, K3s and k3d. Enjoy [Take Argo CD for a spin with K3s
and k3d](https://thecloud.christmas/2020/13)!
